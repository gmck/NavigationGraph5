The fourth xamarin.android NavigationComponent project. Each of the projects contains a Word doc file describing all three projects

NavigationGraph1 – shows the basics of building a Xamarin.Android using Android’s Navigation Component.

NavigationGraph2 – introduces an alternate method of adding animations from one fragment to another.

NavigationGraph3 - this project is quite a departure from the preceding ones. It introduces several new features that could be incorporated into Xamarin.Android project.

June 6th 2022 Added AndroidX.Core.SplashScreen.SplashScreen to the NavigationGraph3 project - see the end section of NavigationGraph.docx

June 27th 2022
NavigationGraph5 

Please note - there is no NavigationGraph4 project.

This is a modification of the NavigationGraph3 project, that uses AndroidX.Core.SplashScreen.SplashScreen with the standard Xamarin Application icon as compared to the previous examples which used a modified Xamarin Application icon for the SplashScreen. This means that any Xamarin.Android project can use their existing application icons with the new SplashScreen API, by utilising the contents of mipmap-anydpi-v26 folder of the application. Please see the NavigationGraph.docx for detailed information.
